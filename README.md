# 🌊 Deep Sea CycleGAN Dataset

This repository contains an **unpaired image dataset** structured for Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) training. The data is intended for the translation of **Shallow Water** aesthetics to a **Deep Sea** aesthetic.

***

## 🐠 Dataset Structure and Sources

The dataset is organized into two primary domains (A and B) and is ready to be used directly in any standard CycleGAN implementation.

| Domain | Source Collection | Content Description | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| **trainA (Source)** | **Ozfish** | Images captured in **clear, shallow water** (coastal, reef, or aquarium environments). |
| **trainB (Target)** | **OceanDark** | Images representing the **dark, deep indigo or deep blue water** aesthetic, typically low-light. |
